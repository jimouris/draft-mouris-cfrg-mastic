      "body": "Consider the following use case: [NEL (\"Network Error Logging\")](https://www.w3.org/TR/network-error-logging/) is a mechanism for web browsers to report network issues (TCP connection failure, TLS handshake failure, DNS resolution failure, ...) to origin servers. This is intended give the server insight into issues potentially affecting many users (e.g., a BGP route leak might result in loss of connectivity to an entire continent). In order to protect user privacy, we can protect the reports with [Prio3Histogram](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf-06.html#name-prio3histogram): each client submits a \"histogram contribution\" like $[0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0]$, where the position of the $1$ indicates the error that occurred.\r\n\r\nRefining the problem a bit more: a content-delivery network, like Cloudflare, terminates connections for many origin servers. In this setting it is useful to collect such a histogram _per-origin_ so that the origin's configuration (TLS parameters, etc.) can be accounted for when investigating the problem. (The more general \"heavy hitters\" version of this problem is described [on this PPM mailing list thread](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ppm/6DEXt2PS3IGOGWcg5hHzgsIGYyg/).) It would also be useful to break down the data by the client's location (which country), user agent (which web browser), etc.\r\n\r\nAn alternative formulation of this problem: suppose a web browser wants to collect some metrics (how long does it take for a certain operation to complete, how much RAM does a tab take, etc.) and break it down by browser version.\r\n\r\nIn general, we'd like to take some metric and split it into buckets based on some \"label\". Prio3Histogram is easy to extend: Instead of a histogram with buckets $B_1, \\ldots, B_m$ we'd have buckets\r\n\r\n$(B_1, L_1), \\ldots, (B_1, L_m), \\ldots, (B_m, L_1), \\ldots (B_m, L_n)$ ,\r\n\r\nwhere $L_1, \\ldots, L_n$ is the list of possible values for a given label. This works fine whenever $n$ is small, but quickly blows up when the number of possible labels grows large.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nDPFs provide part of the solution. In particular, we know how to secret-share a _point function_ that takes as input a label $L_i$ and outputs a vector representing a histogram contribution, or the all-zero string if the report does not have label $L_i$. This allows the Collector to _privately_ break down aggregates by any sequence of label values it wants.\r\n\r\nBut, what about _robustness_? We also want to make sure that each output is either a histogram contribution or the all-zero string. Or put another way, the concatenation of the sequence of outputs should itself be a histogram contribution (i.e., of the form $[0, \\ldots, 0, 1, 0, \\ldots, 0]$).\r\n\r\n**Question 1:** Ho do we extend VDPF for this use case? My understanding from #8 is that the base scheme, on its own, only checks that the output is \"one-hot\", i.e., of the form $[0, \\ldots, 0, x, 0, \\ldots, 0]$, where $x$ is _non-zero_, but not necessarily \"in range\" (i.e., $x\\in\\{0,1\\}$). How does PLASMA implement this range check?\r\n\r\n**Potential generalization:** This may be good enough for many use cases, but it may be possible to generalize further. In particular, each instance of Prio3 is associated with some arithmetic circuit that's used to define input validity (Count, Sum, Histogram, SumVec are all relatively simple examples.) Perhaps we can extend Prio3 to support aggregation-by-label by composing a VDPF with a [\"delayed-input FLP\"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/130) for the circuit.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea of delayed-input FLP is that the client generates a validity proof both for its true input (i.e., the histogram contribution) and the all-zero string. (We require the all-zero string to be a valid input to the circuit.) The verifier then checks both proofs on the _sum_ of the VDPF outputs: the sum will be equal to the client's input if the client's label is among the labels queried by the Collector; and the sum will be zero if the client's label is not in the query. Thus the sum is deemed valid iff exactly one of these proofs verifies.\r\n\r\nFrom our our analysis of [Doplar](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/130), a composition like this should work as long as the VDPF is \"extractable\" (as defined in our paper). The main open question is how to lift a _generic_ FLP into a delayed-input FLP. Our analysis applies to a particular validity circuit.\r\n\r\n**Question 2:** What do you think about pursuing this generalization in this draft? It's not essential to the core functionality of PLASMA, which is to solve heavy hitters. We already have use cases for at least the histogram functionality, so I would like to add that feature at least; but I strongly suspect we will be able to make use of the generalization as well; see  https://github.com/ietf-wg-ppm/draft-ietf-ppm-dap/issues/489.  Note: Hannah Davis (you met at PETS) is available to help us with this, so the lift may not be too much work for you.",

It involves four checks in the three-server setting, but in the two-server setting, we can remove the ones that check for consistency between the three sessions.\r\n\r\n1. The servers verify that the proofs \u03c0 are the same for all three sessions. This ensures that there is at most one path in the binary tree that is non-zero.\r\n2. For the root level (i.e., $k = 0$), the servers evaluate the VIDPF keys on the empty string \u03f5 and verify it is 1.\r\n3. For the kth level, the servers need to verify that $y^{p||0}$ is either 0 or 1, without reconstructing the output (here $p$ is the parent prefix). We perform this check by observing that the output of the parent $p$ should be the sum of the outputs of $p || 0$ and $p || 1$. The servers evaluate the VIDPF keys on the parent string $p$ and sibling (of $p || 0$) string $p || 1$ to obtain secret shares of the output of $y^{p}$ and $y^{p || 1}$, respectively. The servers reconstruct $y^{p} - (y^{p || 0} + y^{p || 1})$ and verify that it is 0. This ensures that _at most_ one of $y^{p || 0}$ and $y^{p || 1}$ is non zero.

The servers evaluate the client DPF keys on points where they want to perform the metrics computation. Each (i, j)th point is a combination of (B_i, L_j). The server computation ranges with the number of combinations they want to consider for the data collection process.

Currently Mastic does not support this feature because the FLP must be verified at level zero before any further output can be validated. Since aggregators do not necessarily store information about previous rounds except when validating aggregation parameters, one suggestion was to change the aggregation parameter to include information about which level was first evaluated. The downside of this is that the aggregation parameter format would become inconsistent with Poplar, and thus introduce changes at the DAP level. \r\n\r\nAnother suggestion, with the same downside, is to change the aggregation parameter format to a tuple of the current aggregation parameter types. Mastic could then support simultaneous aggregation of multiple different levels on the same reports. The validity condition on the new aggregation parameters would be the existing condition applied to the parameters' union. \r\n\r\nThe one solution that doesn't require aggregation parameters to change is to fix the starting level as a parameter of the VDAF scheme.

This is insufficient, because it admits the following attack: An adversarial client generates VIDPF keys honestly for some input alpha, but then throws away the \"w\" part of the correction words in the public share. They can now compute the joint randomness parts, joint randomness seed, and joint randomness field elements, because they only depend on the blinds, VIDPF keys, and nonce (all chosen randomly by honest clients). Next, the dishonest client uses foreknowledge of the joint randomness values to select one of many FLP measurements that result in cancellation during the random linear combination part of the validity circuit. For example, if the circuit is Sum(8), I think they could fix the first seven measurement elements to be, say -1, and then solve to find what value of the eighth measurement element would result in a circuit output of zero. Treating the circuit as a univariate function of the eighth measurement element, it is a quadratic polynomial, known to the attacker, so they should have two zeros to choose from. Now, the attacker can program this adversarially-chosen measurement into the VIDPF by re-running VIDPF key generation, reusing the same initial seeds and alpha. Only the \"w\" parts of the correction words will change. The resulting report would pass one-hotness checks and path checks, because the core seeds/control bits of the VIDPF evaluation were not tampered with. The aggregators would extract the late-programmed adversarial measurement from their collective calls to `VIDPF.eval()` with each key and inputs `0b0` and `0b1`, and it would pass FLP verification by construction.\r\n\r\nThe straightforward fix for this is to compute `beta_share` for each aggregator, as in `Vidpf.eval()`, and replace `vidpf_init_seed[0]`/`vidpf_init_seed[1]` in joint randomness part derivation with each `beta_share`. That way, we would bind joint randomness to the FLP measurement, by binding to both measurement shares. (A less complicated but less efficient option would be to include shares of beta directly in each input share, and use those in both joint randomness derivation and FLP verification, rather than extracting shares of beta from evaluations at `0b0` and `0b1`, as is done currently.)",

This VDAF is similar to Poplar1 except that instead of aggregating counters, Mastic can aggregate any data type that is compatible with FlpGeneric.\r\n\r\nMastic operates in one of two \"modes\", depending on how the VIDPF is configured. In \"incremental mode\", the FLP is checked when evaluating at the first level of the VIDPF tree; in non-incremental mode, the FLP is checked when evaluating the last level of the tree (all intermediate levels are disabled).\r\n\r\nWhen verifying the FLP, the encoded measurement (i.e., `beta`) is computed by evaluating the VIDPF at both child nodes of the root and summing the output shares. By one-hot verifiability, this sum is equal to value claimed by the Client; by path verifiability, checking this value is sufficient each node on the `alpha` path is guaranteed to have the same value.\r\n\r\nThe code is incomplete but is sufficient to illustrate the basic features we want. Some things to do:\r\n\r\n* Add support for circuits with joint randomness\r\n\r\n* Specify `PublicShare` and `InputShare`\r\n\r\n* Decide whether to bind the query randomness to the VIDPF mode\r\n\r\n* Implement message serialization",

In the Overleaf version of the protocol, we evaluate the VIDPF \"at the root\" (i.e.,at the empty string $\\varepsilon$), but this doesn't seem to be possible with the current VIDPF API. (I think Hannah was working on some changes to VIDPF that would have allowed this, but it wasn't compiling and I'm not sure how far she got with it.)\r\n\r\nEvaluating at both children and then summing (as we do here) has a bit of CPU overhead. However it also has some advantages:\r\n1. It's simple to specify\r\n2. It has zero communication overhead. (If evaluating at the root, would we need to send more information in the public share so that the Aggregators can reconstruct shares of the output?)\r\n3. It involves at most one more call to `Vidpf.eval_next()` than is necessary. (If `0` is not a prefix of any string in `prefixes`, then it'll be a waste to evaluate it.)",

However, VIDPFs alone are not sufficient to guarantee that the keys are well formed. The servers still need to verify that: a) the non-zero values of the client are\r\nacross a single path in the binary tree, and b) the value of the root node is correctly propagated down the VIDPF tree. We formalize these requirements as an additional property: Path Verifiability: blah blah blah\r\n\r\nThe idea is that we want $y^\u03b3 - (y^{\u03b3||0} + y^{\u03b3||1}) = 0$. Then the following should hold:\r\n$y_0^\u03b3 - y_0^{\u03b3||0} - y_0^{\u03b3||1} = - y_1^\u03b3 + y_1^{\u03b3||0} + y_1^{\u03b3||1}$.

Indeed, it's possible to use the current VIDPF in a black-box manner and perform the same calculation. However, the resulting algorithm would have asymptotic runtime that is far worse than optimal. Instead, I followed @hannahdaviscrypto's suggestion to modify VIDPF so that it does the path verification itself. The resulting algorithm is as fast as we can hope for, at least asymptotically. (Concretely there is more room for optimization.)\r\n\r\nWhen specifying a complex algorithm like this, it's often useful to write down the asymptotically-optimal version. I think it makes sense to do the same thing here.\r\n\r\nThis PR also stacks some minor changes to `vidpf` that are technically separate. It may help to review commit-by-commit.",

In\r\n  order to compute the share of `beta`, modify `Vidpf` to return the sum\r\n  of the children of the root. This is less redundant because we end up\r\n  visiting these nodes when evaluating the prefix tree. (In effect, this\r\n  some logic in `Mastic` into `Vidpf`.)\r\n\r\n* Remove the `INCREMENTAL_MODE` flag and add a `do_range_check` flag to\r\n  the aggregation parameter. If set, the Aggregators will verify the\r\n  FLP. Accordingly, modify `Mastic.is_valid()` to enforce that the FLP\r\n  is verified the first time (and only the first time) the reports are\r\n  aggregated. Also, check that the level at which the reports are\r\n  aggregated is non-decreasing.\r\n\r\nIn addition, add examples that illustrate the two main \"modes\" for\r\n`Mastic`: \"heavy hitters\" and \"labels\".",

In fact, it supports different thresholds for different prefixes (i.e., even multiple thresholds for different strings as the same level).\r\n\r\nThis technique can be useful to compute heavy-hitting selling items on Amazon based on customer's expenditures. Run the multiple-thresholds protocol over customers spending $ on Amazon purchases. The amount that needs to be spent on specific categories to consider a category as a heavy-hitter might be different. For example, grocery items will have a lower threshold than luxury items. ",

To accomplish this, we do the simplest thing: prepend a field element to each correction word.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, fix a bug in `Mastic.aggregate()` and `Mastic.unshard()` whereby the accumulator vector was initialized to the wrong length.",

      "body": "The GitHub actions for the VDAF draft include various improvements, including running unit tests, type checking, and linting. Update our actions to match theirs make the changes necessary to pass the checks.\r\n\r\n* Remove submodule for draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf; we can now install this from pip directly.\r\n\r\n* Move the tests into their own directory and invoke them with the unittest module. This revealed a few issues:\r\n\r\n  * The VIDPF tests needed some adjusting: we had modified the code so that the output share includes the counter, but never updated the tests to account for this. This was not being checked by the current GitHub actions.\r\n\r\n  * `Vdaf` no longer has a class method called `domain_separation_tag()`. Implement this here, using the Mastic draft version instead of the VDAF draft version.\r\n\r\n  * `FlpGeneric` was renamed to `FlpBBCGGI19` and its attribute `Field` was renamed to `field`. Relatedly, the circuit constructor takes in a field as input.\r\n\r\n* Enforce type hints and fix misalignments with the `Vdaf` API. The main change is that we've dropped the class factory pattern in favor of more conventional Python OOP. Likewise for `Vidpf`.\r\n\r\n* Remove `do_range_check: bool` from the prep state and let this be determined by whether `corrected_joint_rand_seed: Optional[bytes]` is set.\r\n\r\n    * Note: enforcing types revealed a few awkward bits of control flow,\r\n      including this.",

At the moment, we overload `Vdaf.domain_separation_tag()` to use our own `VERSION`, but we invoke `format_tag()`, which uses the version from the VDAF draft. Eventually we'll want to use our own version for both; for the moment, the minimally invasive change is to just use upstream.\r\n\r\n* Add a NOTE about an apparent bug that's blocking us from making the XOF generic. This may be a `Vdaf` bug or a bug with `Generic` itself. While at it, deduplicate the code for deriving the prove randomness.\r\n\r\n* Modify query randomness derivation by binding to the level. We only generate query randomness once, so this may not be strictly necessary. But this does provide domain separation whenever the aggregation starts at different levels.\r\n\r\n    * Note: The TODO suggested binding to the aggregation parameter as\r\n      well, but this doesn't seem necessary as the FLP can only be used\r\n      once.\r\n\r\n* Align correction word encoding with the IDPF specification in the base draft. Note that the considerations are a little different because we don't have a concept of \"inner field\" versus \"leaf field\", but consistency is nice.\r\n\r\n* Rename the \"counter\" to the \"counter check\" and the \"path\" to the \"payload check\".\r\n\r\n* Refer to the \"VIDPF proof\" from {{MST24}} as the \"path proof\". This is to distinguish it from the \"evaluation proof\", which includes the path proof and the counter and payload checks.",

The main goal was to reduce the number of type assertions we needed.\r\n\r\n* Remove \"flp_\" and \"vidpf_\" prefixes from variable names wherever which primitive they're associated with is clear in context.\r\n\r\n* Avoid nesting the term \"public share\". In other words, Mastic's public is composed of VIDPF correction words and FLP joint rand parts; make these components explicit. This avoids confusing variable aliases, like `flp_public_share = joint_rand_parts`.\r\n\r\n* Make `is_valid()` stricter by preventing aggregating at the same level of the VIDPF tree more than once. We don't know if this is secure, and in any case, this behavior isn't covered by the current proof. Also, try and make the spec of `is_valid()` a little simpler.\r\n\r\n* Align the FLP joint randomness confirmation with @hannahdaviscrypto's implementation. Namely, the prep share includes the aggregator's joint randomness part, and `prep_shares_to_prep()` combines them into the true joint randomness seed. Then `prep_next()` just confirms that the true joint randomness seed matches the one it computed during `prep_init()`.\r\n\r\n* Add a unit test that exercises Mastic with joint randomness. We had been testing this, with the `Sum` circuit; but the `Sum` circuit no longer uses joint randomness in the latest version of the base draft.\r\n\r\n* Improve `is_valid()` unit tests by replacing `assert`s with `self.assertTrue()`s.",

Which document gets `0x00000007` depends largely on who gets to RFC first.\r\n\r\nOf course, we could just pick codepoints in the IANA range and change them if they get allocated by someone else, but it's better for everyone if we can avoid the collision altogether.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, the only we reason we need codepoints is to generate test vectors. My suggestion would be to choose from the private range; as we get closer to finishing, we can ask IANA for new codepoints from the standardized range.\r\n\r\nBut again, I think it's too early to create this table.",

For example, it can be any function that needs to be imported from `common.py`. Or is it more subjective (i.e., _here are some functions that we often use_)?\r\n\r\nThis is the complete list of basic functions that the specifications of Prio3 and Poplar1 use, but we don't explicitly define in full detail. What they do _should_ be clear from the description; if anything is unclear, let me know :)\r\n\r\n> In our case, I think it is reasonable to list the imported functions that are referenced in our text (along with basic functionalities). As a reader, I find it useful to have these definitions in one place (but personal preferences can differ on this). If it makes more sense, we can split the list to basic functions and APIs.\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, we should split the basic functions and APIs into separate lists. If we're going to re-define the APIs (by this I mean the `Field`, `Xof`, and `Flp` classes defined in {{!VDAF}}), then they also need to be more complete then they are currently. Each API is consists not just of instance methods, e.g., `flp.encode()`, but potentially class methods or constructors, e.g., `XofTurboShake128()`. They also define constants, e.g., `flp.MEAS_LEN` and have generic parameters, e.g., `F`.\r\n\r\nBut again, I don't think we should be re-defining APIs. Not only does this make our jobs harder in the short term, I don't think it helps much with an RFC. These documents are not meant to be self-contained as long as dependencies have clear refernces.",

Once merged, I'll follow up with a PR to update the draft itself.\r\n\r\nWe are working on a Rust implementation of Mastic: https://github.com/divviup/libprio-rs/issues/947\r\n\r\nThis commit incorporates a few improvements based on this experience:\r\n\r\n1. Move the joint randomness part hints from the public share to the input shares. This simplifies the types and saves a bit of communication. (#80)\r\n\r\n2. Let `beta` denote the value that is programmed into the output of the VIDPF. Currently the VIDPF prepends the counter internally.\r\n\r\n3. Reorder the order in which the leader and helper seed are read from the sharding randomness. The new order ensures we always read the seeds in the same order regardless of whether FLP joint randomness is required.\r\n\r\n4. When computing the FLP joint randomness, bind to the weight shares rather than to the VIDPF key share. (#81)\r\n\r\n5. Add Mastic type parameters to the test vectors.\r\n\r\n6. Swap the order of the joint rand part and the verifier share in the prep share encoding.\r\n\r\n7. Prehash the payload check in order to avoid having to store the entire string. (#92)\r\n\r\n8. VIDPF: Decouple onehot proof computation from `eval_next()`. We now compute the explicit prefix tree from the candidate prefixes, then compute both the onehot proof and payload check via a breadth-first traversal of the prefix tree.\r\n\r\n9. VIDPF: Add a method for obtaining the aggregator's share of `beta`.",

I think it's more natural to align with what we have in the paper.",

      "body": "Closes #100.\r\n\r\nCurrently VIDPF computes the evaluation proof, which is largely Mastic-specific. For instance, we would like to bind Mastic preparation to the VDAF algorithm ID, as this allows for domain separation across different weight types. But other applications of VIDPF may have different requirements for domain separation.\r\n\r\nThis commit moves the eval proof computation to Mastic. VIDPF now just computes the prefix tree and returns the root and leaves it up to applications to do something with the result.\r\n\r\nTo maintain the current test coverage, we also make the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. Add a method on VIDPF, `test_eval()` that computes the hash of the node proofs and returns that instead of the prefix tree.\r\n\r\n2. Move the `test_malformed_correction_word_payload()` to the Mastic tests. The node proof is not actually sensitive to changes to the payload correction word, but payload check is.",

For example, for the `Sum` type, the length of the encoded measurement depends on the validity range, but the truncated measurement is a single field element. We can therefore significantly reduce the size of the correction words by programming the VIDPF with the truncated weight instead of the full encoded weight.\r\n\r\nTo make this work, we secret share the encoded weight precisely as in Prio3. We then extend the payload check by setting the root payload to the counter plus the encoded truncated weight carried by the encoded input share.\r\n\r\nThis change only saves communication cost when `mastic.flp.MEAS_LEN > mastic.flp.OUTPUT_LEN` and `mastic.vidpf.BITS` is sufficiently large. Of the currently defined variants, only `MasticSum` will see savings. For `MasticCount`, `MasticSumVec`, and `MasticHistogram` the Leader's share increases by `mastic.flp.MEAS_LEN` field elements.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of this change is that the payload check detects malformed correction word payloads at the first level of the tree.\r\n\r\nRelated clean up:\r\n\r\n1. Add another usage domain separator for the helper's weight share and renumber.\r\n\r\n2. Simplify the `MasticInputShare` type by defining classes for the leader and helper shares.\r\n\r\n3. vidpf: Remove `get_beta_share()` as it's no longer used.",
